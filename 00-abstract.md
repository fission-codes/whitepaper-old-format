The past decade has seen a number of major innovations in distributed systems, decentralized technologies, open source collaboration, commons infrastructure, and new classes of license. At the same time, development on cloud platforms has become increasingly complex. We are also in the midst of unprecidented cultural awareness of technology's impact on politics, control, and public safety.

To meet the needs of 2020, 2025, and beyond, we introduce Asimov: a web-scale, secure-by-default, where users own and control their identity and data, code is executable on any machine, and deployment as a separate stage is an antiquated concept.
