The web of 2019 is in flux. On one had

# Setting the Stage

## Software Trends

* Increasing abstraction
  * Containers
    * Specialist DevOps
    * Kubernetes difficult billing
  * FaaS / Serverless
    * Still early in its curve
  * Wasm Isolates
* Difficult to compete with the rolling weight of the Big Four

## Social Trends

* Data security
* Lock-in fatigue
* Scandals: Snowden, Cambridge Analytica
* Apple has begun selling its services as "more secure"

# Paradeigm Shift

> If your world is all screwed up 
> Rearrange it

* Content addressing gives us a single unified namespace
  * Portablility
* Constraints of this system mean that it should be secure-by-default

# Core Assumptions

## Humanity

* People are fundamentally lazy
  * Want to change as little as possible
    * Momentum
    * Familiarity-as-UX
* Systemically, we tend towards centralization and capture
* Periodic paradeigm shifts that allow for increased freedom, competition, and efficiency
* Socially, end-users are becoming aware of the dangers of concentrated technological power

## Technology

* Decentralized IDs will happen
  * W3C
  * Microsoft
  * BC Government
* Wasm is going to be available everywhere

* Content addressing will effectively make data location a non-issue

# The End of History

The past 60 years have been a progression from bespoke hardware, through mainframes, timeshare, hardware owneership, cloud computing, containers, FaaS, and finally hostless systems
